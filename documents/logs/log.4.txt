Problems in halconfig:
- WARNING There is a newer version of Halyard available (1.32.0),
  please update when possible
? Run 'sudo update-halyard' to upgrade

Problems in default.provider.dockerRegistry.dockerhub:
- WARNING You have a supplied a username but no password.

Problems in default.security:
- WARNING Your UI or API domain does not have override base URLs
  set even though your Spinnaker deployment is a Distributed deployment on a
  remote cloud provider. As a result, you will need to open SSH tunnels against
  that deployment to access Spinnaker.
? We recommend that you instead configure an authentication
  mechanism (OAuth2, SAML2, or x509) to make it easier to access Spinnaker
  securely, and then register the intended Domain and IP addresses that your
  publicly facing services will be using.
